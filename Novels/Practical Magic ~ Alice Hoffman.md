The Owens sisters confront the challenges of life and love in this bewitching novel from _New York Times_ bestselling author Alice Hoffman.

But all Gillian and Sally wanted was to escape.  
  
One will do so by marrying, the other by running away. But the bonds they share will bring them back—almost as if by magic...
