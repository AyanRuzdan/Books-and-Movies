Have you ever:  
• Invested time in something that, with hindsight, just wasn't worth it?  
• Overpayed in an Ebay auction?  
• Continued doing something you knew was bad for you?  
• Sold stocks too late, or too early?  
• Taken credit for success, but blamed failure on external circumstances?  
• Backed the wrong horse?  
  
These are examples of cognitive biases, simple errors we all make in our day-to-day thinking. But by knowing what they are and how to spot them, we can avoid them and make better choices-whether dealing with a personal problem or a business negotiation; trying to save money or make money; working out what we do or don't want in life: and how best to get it.  
  
Simple, clear and always surprising, this indispensable book will change the way you think and transform your decision-making-work, at home, every day. It reveals, in 99 short chapters, the most common errors of judgment, and how to avoid them.
